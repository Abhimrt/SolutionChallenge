    <p> Usually, small in size compared to its competitors, the Ashoka tree is an extraordinary tree with aromatic flowers and an erect stem. The Ashoka tree is a rainforest tree spread across the Indian subcontinent. The tree is popular for its mesmerizing beauty along with its ability to cleanse the air around it. They absorb toxic gases, particulate matter and enrich the atmosphere with clean oxygen. The survival of many living organisms is dependent on trees, such as Ashoka itself. This is a useful tree that is becoming vulnerable and demands more plantations to preserve its unique species.
<br />
It would be useful to consider an array of Ashoka trees around your society/ place of residence to elevate the beauty of your home and the oxygen content of the air around you.</p>
