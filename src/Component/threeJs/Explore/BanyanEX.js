        <p> The next three on the list is the banyan tree. This beneficial tree is a national tree of India that releases oxygen and absorbs CO2, and that is why it stands on the list of most oxygen-producing trees in India. The World’s largest banyan tree is in Kolkata, named is Thimmamma Marrimanu and Dodda Alada Mara. It is also known as Badh, Vat, Bargad, and Alai. The banyan tree is prevalent for its ability to emit a large amount of oxygen. If we look at it from a religious point of view, it is a very venerable tree because it has been considered as the first Tirthankara in religious texts. Under this tree, Adinath had attained knowledge. It is one of the best oxygen-producing trees and provides a large canopy of shade. </p>
